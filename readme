## ✨ Key Features
visit errormetrics.com and start prompting.
| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **WER Calculation** | Industry-standard formula: `(S + D + I) / N × 100%` using Levenshtein distance at the word level |
| **Visual Diff Analysis** | Color-coded highlighting of substitutions, deletions, and insertions between reference and hypothesis |
| **Batch Processing** | Analyze multiple transcript pairs at once with aggregate stats, accuracy distributions, and error heatmaps |
| **Engine Comparison** | Compare multiple ASR engines side-by-side against a single reference transcript |
| **Analysis History** | Automatic saving of results to browser localStorage for easy access to past comparisons |
| **Multilingual Support** | Pre-loaded examples in English, Spanish, Arabic, and Mandarin Chinese |
| **Privacy First** | Zero server uploads, zero API calls, zero cookies, zero tracking |
| **Works Offline** | Fully functional after initial page load — even behind corporate firewalls |
Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**
## 🎯 Who Is This For?
If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. 
- **ASR Engineers** — Fine-tune speech recognition models by identifying systematic error patterns
- **QA Teams** — Validate ASR quality in production, set benchmarks, and ensure SLAs with objective metrics
- **ML Researchers** — Compare architectures, evaluate training approaches, and publish reproducible accuracy metrics
- **Product Managers** — Make data-driven decisions about ASR providers and evaluate switching ROI
- **NLP Engineers** — Assess downstream impact of transcription errors on text processing pipelines
The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

## Corporate Network Compatibility
## 🏢 Corporate Network Compatibility
Error Metrics is designed to work seamlessly behind corporate firewalls and restrictive network policies:
- **100% Client-Side Processing**: All WER calculations and analysis happen in your browser - no server-side processing required
- **Zero Hard Dependencies**: Core functionality works completely offline once loaded
- **Graceful Degradation**: Optional 3D background automatically falls back to CSS animations if external resources are blocked
- **No Data Transmission**: Your transcripts never leave your device - all storage is local
- **Self-Hosted Assets**: All critical resources are bundled, eliminating external dependencies

To connect a domain, navigate to Project > Settings > Domains and click Connect Domain.
## 📐 WER Formula
Read more here: [Setting up a custom domain](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/custom-domain#custom-domain)
```
WER = (S + D + I) / N × 100%
```
| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **S** | Substitutions — words replaced with incorrect words |
| **D** | Deletions — words present in reference but missing from hypothesis |
| **I** | Insertions — words in hypothesis that don't appear in reference |
| **N** | Total number of words in the reference transcript |
